Audio Batch Organizer
=====================

This program is used to edit audio file metadata (like title, track number,
disc number, artists) in batch, and organize audio files based on metadata.

Typical use cases include:

* dump metadata from audio files as text files for editing
* remap updated metadata back to audio files
* reformat file names based on metadata, for example, to `<title> - <artist>`
* sort files into sub-directories based on metadata, for example, per album
* split CD extract into tracks based on CUE file


External dependencies
---------------------

* `ffmpeg`: required to transcode between audio formats, read and remap metadata
* `shntools`: required to split with CUE file
* `sox`: required to draw audio spectrogram

Installation
------------
